# uncomtrademisc 2022.09.21

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* I added the option to return units in the tidy output
* As far as I've tested, the changes are compatible with the previous
  version.\
* Running `tidy_flows()` with default parameters returns the
  same output as in previous releases.
